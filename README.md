## Logistic-regression-classification

## Overview
This repository contains a Machine Learning project implemented in Python using the **Logistic Regression** algorithm. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for a classification problem.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Project Structure
logistic-regression-classification/
│
├── logistic_regression.ipynb # Jupyter Notebook with implementation
├── dataset.csv # Dataset used (if applicable)
├── README.md # Project documentation


## Workflow
1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Feature scaling  
4. Train-test split  
5. Logistic Regression model training  
6. Model evaluation  

## Algorithm Used
- **Logistic Regression**
- Implemented using **scikit-learn**

## Results
The model provides reliable classification performance. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report are included in the notebook.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/logistic-regression-classification.git
2. Open the notebook:
jupyter notebook logistic_regression.ipynb

3. Run all cells sequentially.
